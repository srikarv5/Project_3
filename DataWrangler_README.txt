Map.java
 - The class that uses GraphADT and extends CS400Graph classes to describe objects that represent geographical maps with locations and routes. 

MapData.csv
- The CSV file containing the input data of the UW Building Map with connecting routes and distances. Roughly represents the buildings and distances at the center of campus.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I helped the Backend in how to implement my class and also explained the ways we should go about storing the map. I also created "fake" Backend and Frontend classes early on to test that my code works.
